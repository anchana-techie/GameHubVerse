# Game Hub – Architecture & Documentation

Game Hub is a static web app (no build step, no application server). Everything runs in the browser; the only cloud services are the free PeerJS matchmaking server, Firebase (accounts + Firestore) and optionally EmailJS.

## 1. Layers at a glance

| Layer | What it does | Where in the code |
|---|---|---|
| **User Interaction** | Home screen, sign-in / register, room lobby, game screens, My Activity, Admin dashboard, offline and system pages | `landingHTML`, `entryHTML`, `roomHTML`, `*GameHTML`, `authHTML`, `adminHTML`, `myStatsHTML`, `offlineHTML` |
| **Game** | The **host's browser** is the game server: it owns the room, runs the rules, timers and computer players, and sends every player a personal view | `doAct`, `deal`, `hostTick`, `viewFor` / `gameView`, `*Deal / *Act / *Tick` per game |
| **Networking** | Room code / invite link, WebRTC connections through PeerJS, message passing, reconnect | `createRoom`, `joinRoom`, `dispatch`, `pushState`, `iceConfig` |
| **Accounts & Data** | Invite-only sign-in, roles, activity tracking, password recovery | `fb*`, `auth*`, `adm*`, `track*`, `rc*`, `firestore.rules` |
| **Infrastructure** | GitHub Pages hosting, service worker cache, browser storage, Firebase project, PeerJS cloud | `sw.js`, `firebase-config.js` |

Cross-cutting: authentication / authorisation (invite-only, `role: "admin"`), activity tracking and presence, Firestore security rules, offline / error pages and automatic reconnect.

## 3. How a game runs

1. **Create / join.** The host creates a room (a 5-letter code, PeerJS id `wfg-<CODE>`); guests open the invite link (`?room=CODE`) or type the code.
2. **Lobby.** The host changes settings (`SETTINGS` / `DEFAULTS`) and starts the game (`startGame` → `deal`).
3. **Play.** A player's click becomes an *action* (`sendAct`). A guest sends `{t:"act"}` to the host; the host runs `dispatch → doAct →` the game's `*Act` function and then `pushState`, which sends every player a **personal view** (`viewFor`). Secrets (words, roles, hidden throws) are filtered out of other players' views.
4. **Timers & computers.** `hostTick` runs every 500 ms: it handles time-outs, computer moves (chess engine, Ludo bot, Rock Paper Scissors) and disconnected players.
5. **Reveal → next round → end.** Phases are `lobby → play → end` for the room and `… → reveal` inside a game. The host presses *Next round*, *New game* or *Back to lobby*.
6. **Leaving.** A player who leaves or is kicked is out: Ludo tokens and chess pieces are removed, a see-through airlock cut-scene plays, and games that fall below their minimum player count stop.

### Messages between peers
| Direction | Message | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| guest → host | `join` (pid, name, avatar) | enter the room |
| guest → host | `act` (`m`) | any game action |
| guest → host | `draw` | Scribblio strokes |
| host → guest | `state` (`s`) | the player's personal view |
| host → guest | `toast` | a private notice or error |
| host → guest | `kicked` | removed by the host |
| host → guest | `draw` | relayed Scribblio strokes |

### Mates: game requests and one-to-one chat
Peer to peer, outside any room (`mate*` functions). Nothing is written to Firebase or any server.
- Every signed-in player with groups opens a personal PeerJS peer, id `wfgm-<hash of login e-mail>` (`mateId`), so a mate can reach them while their tab is open. A second tab of the same person can send but not receive.
- A connection opens with `{t:"hi",from}`; only people in the receiver's groups (`prPeople`) are accepted, and their shown name comes from the group list. The sender's e-mail is not cryptographically verified – fine among friends.
- Messages: `inv` (game, room code) → pop-up with Accept / Decline (60 s), `invr` (accepted / declined), `msg` (chat line, max 500 chars), `ack` (delivered).
- Requests come from the My groups panel (`mateInviteNew` creates the room, then `mateAfterRoom` sends the request) or the lobby's Invite mates card (`mateInvite`).
- Chats are kept in `sessionStorage gh_mchat` only (tab lifetime), wiped on sign-out.

### Voice chat
Optional group call for everyone in a room (`voice*` functions, floating 🎙 dock). It is a WebRTC mesh using PeerJS media calls, so audio flows directly between players, encrypted (DTLS-SRTP), and never touches Firebase or is recorded.
- The mic opens only after the player taps **Join voice** (https required) and starts **off**; leaving voice releases the microphone.
- The host publishes the voice roster (peer ids taken from the real connections, `voiceAct`). Players answer calls only from peers on that roster; admin watchers are never on it.
- The host can mute any player or turn voice off for the room; receivers enforce it too. Players get open mic or push-to-talk (hold **V**), speaker off, volume and a speaking indicator.
- The same TURN settings as game data (`iceConfig`) apply to voice.

If players can't connect (strict networks), *Connection help* accepts a TURN relay's credentials (`iceConfig`).

## 4. Accounts, invites and admin (Firebase)

Enabled only when `firebase-config.js` contains real keys; otherwise the hub runs without login.

### Sign-up rules
- Only an e-mail the admin has **invited** can register – checked by the app and by Firestore rules.
- Sign-in is e-mail + password. E-mails are **not** verified (they are only IDs).
- **Forgot password** uses a **security question** chosen at registration: the password is stored encrypted under a key derived from the answer (PBKDF2 → AES-GCM) in `recovery/<email>`. A strong answer matters.
- A person removed by the admin loses access immediately, can't register again until re-invited, and their leftover sign-in record is deleted the next time they try to sign in.

### Roles
- Roles are stored on the profile: `users/<uid>.role` is `"user"` or `"admin"`.
- The first admin is created by hand in the Firebase console (see [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](../FIREBASE_SETUP.md)); admins can then promote or demote others in the Admin dashboard.

### Firestore data model
| Collection | Key | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `invites` | `<email>` | `email`, `name`, `status` (`invited` / `registered` / `removed`), `invitedAt`, `invitedBy`, `uid`, `registeredAt`, `removedAt` |
| `users` | `<uid>` | `email`, `name`, `role`, `createdAt`, `lastLoginAt`, `lastSeen`, `online`, `loginCount`, `device`, `gamesPlayed`, `totalSeconds`, `lastGame`, `lastPlayedAt`, `stats.<game>` = `played`, `hosted`, `completed`, `wins`, `score`, `seconds`, `last` |
| `users/<uid>/activity` | auto id | `type` (`login` / `game`), `at`, `device`, `first`; for games: `game`, `role` (host / player), `durationSec`, `completed`, `won`, `score`, `players`, `room` |
| `recovery` | `<email>` | `q` (question), `salt`, `iv`, `ct`, `iter`, `updatedAt` |

### Activity tracking
Each signed-in browser records its own data: a sign-in per tab session, a 60-second heartbeat (`lastSeen`, `online`), and per game: start (`played`, `hosted`), end (`completed`, `wins`, `score`, `seconds`) and an activity entry (`trackRoom` / `trackEnd`). Admins read all of it live (`onSnapshot`) in the Admin dashboard.

### Admin dashboard
Summary cards (accounts, invited, online now, active in 7 days, games played, play time, most played game), invite form (with copy-link and optional e-mail through EmailJS), and a searchable People table: status, last sign-in, sign-ins, games and play time, device, with per-game statistics and recent activity per person. Actions: invite, revoke, re-invite, remove, make / remove admin.

### Security rules (`firestore.rules`)
- `invites`: anyone may read one invite by e-mail (to validate registration); only admins list, create or delete; a person may flip their own invite `invited → registered`.
- `recovery`: readable by e-mail while signed out; only that person (or an admin) can write or delete it.
- `users`: a person reads and updates their own profile (but cannot change `role` or `email`); creating a profile requires an `invited` invite and `role: "user"`; admins read, update and delete all.
- `users/<uid>/activity`: the owner creates and reads; admins read and delete.

## 5. Offline and caching
- `sw.js` (service worker): pages are network-first with a saved copy, libraries and fonts come from the cache and refresh in the background; PeerJS signalling, EmailJS and connectivity probes are never touched.
- Chess, the Number Game, Ludo and Rock Paper Scissors can run on one device with no internet (`OFFLINE_OK`, `createLocalRoom`). If the Firebase scripts can't load while offline the hub runs signed-out.
- System pages (`#/loading`, `#/error`, `#/no-internet`, `#/404`, `#/offline-mode`) cover start-up, errors and no connection.

## 6. Browser storage
| Key | Content |
|---|---|
| `localStorage ngg_me` | player name and avatar |
| `localStorage ngg_turn`, `xm_emailjs` | TURN relay and EmailJS settings |
| `localStorage ngg_mute` | cut-scene sound toggle |
| `sessionStorage ngg_pid`, `ngg_room` | this tab's player id and the room to rejoin after a refresh |
| `sessionStorage gh_login_<uid>` | marks that this tab's sign-in was already counted |
| `sessionStorage gh_upd` | time of the last automatic update reload |
| `sessionStorage gh_mchat` | this tab's one-to-one chats and unread counts (gone when the tab closes) |

## 7. Files
| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | the entire app (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) |
| `sw.js` | service worker for offline use |
| `offline.html`, `404.html` | fallback and not-found pages |
| `firebase-config.js` | Firebase web keys (public by design) |
| `firestore.rules` | Firestore security rules – publish in the Firebase console |
| `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` | step-by-step Firebase setup |
| `docs/architecture.svg`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | this documentation |

## 8. Limits to know about
- The **host's browser is the server**: if the host closes the tab, the room ends.
- Game statistics are written by each player's browser – fine for friends, not tamper-proof.
- Deleting another person's Firebase sign-in record needs Cloud Functions / the Admin SDK, which this project does not use.
- Free Firebase (Spark) plan and the free PeerJS server are enough; there are no paid components.
